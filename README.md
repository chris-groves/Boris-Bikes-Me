# Boris Bikes
A Ruby based programme to support the operating of London's 'Boris Bikes'. This is a system whereby members of the public can pick up pedal bikes to use from various locations around the city.

The goal is to refine my programming skills in the following areas:

* test driving the development of a programme
* debugging
* adhering to object orientated principles such as encapsulation

The project originates from the Makers Academy coding bootcamp - further details can be found here:
